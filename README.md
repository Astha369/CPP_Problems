<h1>HACKTOBERFEST 2023</h1>
<p>Hacktoberfest, a celebration of open-source contributions, is back for its 10th year. This year, developers are encouraged to tackle project issues and requests, making it a great time to learn and contribute.</p>
<br> <p>This is my first time being a maintainer of the repository in this Open-Source event. The repository is a simple compilation of CPP codes of various problems, feel free to contribute to it.</p>

<br>
<h3>First Time Contributing?</h3>
<br>No worries, here is the guide.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Start by registering on the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/">Hacktoberfest</a> site using GitHub.</li>
  <li>Once done with this step, fork this repository into your profile.</li>
  <li>Clone the folder to your system, using either "Download Zip Folder" or "Clone using the link".</li>
  <li>Add your cpp code along with a small comment describing the problem.</li>
  <li>Commit the changes to the branch.</li>
  <li>Create a pull request of the commit.</li>
  <li>Wait for some time to get your changes merged and a few more minutes for the changes to be reflected on your Hacktoberfest profile.</li>
